Some CSV files allow some lines to be treated as comment lines, ignored when importing data, but useful for editing/maintenance).\n\nEach tool using CSV files should document the effective format expected! Other better (less ambiguous) formats commonly used for tabular data files are JSON and XML.\n\nDo not confuse with the acronym '''CVS''' for \"Concurrent Versions System\" or \"Concurrent Versioning System\" (\"Subversion\" and \"Git\" are other common related systems for version control used in cooperative development projects).",
